Processing and cleaning the data
=================================
At first 'run_analysis.R' script loads train and test files to dataframes. 
Column names are loaded from "features.txt" file. Descriptive names are generated by removing "(),-" characters.
Two extra columns  "label_id" and "subject_id" are added to dataframes. That columns represents data loaded from "y_####.txt","subject_####.txt". Finnaly train and test datasets are merged.

On a next step, mean and std variables are searched using descriptive column names. Dataframe is created with  mean and std variables.

Then activity labels are loaded and merged with a dataframe.

Finnaly, tidy dataframe is generated by summarizing numeric colunms with a mean function. Output dataset is grouped by label and subject.

For each record it is provided:
======================================
 - Label: factor that describes activity
 - subject_id: an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment
 - Measure: feature name
 - Axis: Axis variable. X, Y, Z or NA for features that do not have axis identificator 
 - mean: mean value for feature
 - std : std value for feature
 
 Script separted messy columns to a new tidy representation.
 For example "tBodyAcc_mean_Y" will generate "TBodyAcc" feature, "Y" axis, and mean value in a new tidy dataset. 
 As a result each variable forms a column, and each observation forms a row.
